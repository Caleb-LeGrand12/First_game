## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I DIDN'T USE ANY]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[THIS BEING MY FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH WEB DEVELOPMENT TOOLS;  I THEREFORE HAD TO PUSH MYSELF	TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CODE MEANT, AN EXAMPLE I CAN GIVE IS ABOUT HOW THE DIFFERENT SOUND TONES WERE PRODUCED( I COULDN'T GET MY HEAD AROUND THAT) 
AND AFTER I DID, I TRIED GENERATING RANDOM DIGITS IN THAT ARRAY; HOWEVER, IT WAS ABOVE MY CAPABILITIES. 
THE OTHER CHALLENGE WAS UNDERSTANDING HOW THE DOM WORKS; IT TOOK ME A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME TO GET MY HEAD AROUND IT.
OTHER THAN THAT THE PROCESS WAS SMOOTH  OFCOURSE AFTER REVIEWING THE CODE MULTIPLE TIMES FOR  A BETTER UNDERSTANDING.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[TO THIS MOMENT I HAVE NO QUESTIONS ON MY MIND; I BELIEVE WITH MORE EXERCISES AND PROJECTS, THE CODE WILL BE MUCH DIGESTIBLE.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[AS ALREADY STATED, I TRIED TO GENERATE RANDOMLY AN ARRAY OF HOW THE BUTTONS SHOULD BE PLAYED.
WITH MORE TIME AND EXPERIENCE I WOULD DEFINITELY TRY TO IMPROVE THAT! 
SECOND OF ALL  I WOULD ALSO MAKE THE SOUND GENERATE RANDOMLY AS LONG AS IN A PREDEFINED STATED RANGE, SO THAT THE GAME DOESN'T SOUND THE SAME EVERY TIME A USER RESTARTS IT]
